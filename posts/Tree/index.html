      <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Tree - I</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       The nameless man stood beneath the colorless sky of a world that held only one tree: a twisted trunk with roots like black veins, sucking the cracked earth dry. Years ago, he had migrated to another world—one that also had only a single tree. Every night, he poured water from his wooden bowl at its base and caressed its decaying leaves, as though that were the only language it understood.

But the tree grew in silence; its branches tore through the roof of his clay house, and its roots devoured the walls. When the storm came, the tree collapsed onto his home with a backbreaking gust. The man knelt among the ruins and laughed—a bitter laugh, echoing from the depths of a dark well. There was always a tree in the world, but he had never seen the world inside the tree.

He was hurled into a new world once more; the soil still cold, the sky still pale, and a single, solitary tree once again. This time, he watched it from afar. Its branches resembled hungry hands reaching out to nothing. Perhaps he feared, perhaps he hoped. But one night, heavy rain began to fall. Unthinking, he grabbed his broken bowl and ran toward the tree. Maybe this time would be different. Maybe this tree would be grateful. Yet as the first drop touched its roots, the ground beneath him quivered. The tree slowly began to rot—as if the new world had been dead from the very beginning.

He dropped the bowl and stared at the sky. Rain washed his face, but he no longer knew whether it was tears or the storm. The withering tree slowly turned to dust, and the man, amidst the heavy silence of the world, was left alone.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes. He stood beneath the pale sky of a world that had only one tree. He was in the first line of the story again. But this time, he smiled. Perhaps this time, he wouldn’t plant the tree. Perhaps this time, he would leave it be. Yet his hands, beyond his will, reached for the bowl.

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Tree - II</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The man looked at the bowl, still trembling in his hands. The rain had stopped, and a heavy silence ruled the colorless world around him. The tree appeared wilted and hunched, as though it too were caught in a cycle it no longer had the strength to break. The man looked up at the sky again, and something began to stir within him—something deeper than despair, something that oddly resembled freedom.

With each step toward the tree, his body grew heavier. Not from fatigue, but from a strange sensation gradually blooming inside—a feeling akin to calm, to surrender. The hand holding the cracked bowl began to shake; there was nothing left in it anymore.

When he reached the tree, he stood still. It remained, unchanged, reaching endlessly toward the sky—aimless, directionless. In that moment, he felt that maybe the tree had understood something in its stillness that he never had. Perhaps the tree was only waiting—for the end of all things, for the cycle to finally stop.

He bent gently toward the tree and closed his eyes. A profound sense awakened within him: there was no longer a need to struggle. In the end, he no longer wished to live. His body could no longer bear the endless loop. The only thing that had tethered him to this world was the fear of what might come after death. But now, there was no fear. Something in him grew quiet, as if all his burdens were being lifted one by one.

Suddenly, he leaned back and fell toward the tree. The fall was silent, painless. It was as though his body were being pulled down—not abruptly, but softly, like a tree’s branches lowering themselves at the end of their life. Nothing stood in his way now.

The tree remained unmoved, as though it had never witnessed the moment. The world remained just as it was.

But then, the man awoke again. He was back in the same world, beneath the same pale sky and lifeless earth. This time, however, the tree was gone. And in the distance, he saw a man walking toward him, holding a bowl of water...
      </p>
      <br>
                  <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Tree - III</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">

        The second man picked up the bowl.
The water inside was heavy, as if it carried more than liquid—something like expectation.
He walked toward the tree: a lone figure in a world stripped of color, soundless, timeless.

The tree stood dry, yet upright.
Its branches stretched aimlessly into the sky.
Its roots sank into a soil where nothing grew anymore.
The man bent down, raised the bowl, and gently poured the water at the base of the tree.

A moment passed.
No response.
Only silence.

He returned. Brought water again. Poured it once more.
Yet the tree remained—dry, unmoving, unanswering.

Until one night, when he heard the roof begin to crack.

The man woke in panic.
He stepped outside and saw the roof of his clay hut shattered, its fragments scattered in the wind.
The next day, the walls began to fracture.
Each time he tried to save the tree, something in his world crumbled.

He screamed:
“Why?! I just want to help!”

But the tree stood silent—
like something no longer human, yet still holding the memory of once having been.

He went mad.
He shouted, hurled stones at the tree, dug up the soil.
But the tree remained, calm—
in a silence that swallowed rage.

And in that moment, the second man understood something.
Perhaps this tree had once been a man.
Perhaps it too had once come bearing a bowl of water for another tree.
And maybe... it had once been him.

Something collapsed inside him.
Not anger, not despair.
But a quiet understanding—like an ember buried beneath ashes.

He sat down.
He looked at the tree.
For the first time, not to save it, but to understand it.

Slowly, he stood up.
Gathered a few brittle branches from the tree’s side.
Built a fire from the remnants of his fallen roof.
And touched the flame to the tree’s trunk.

The tree did not flinch.
It did not burn—it was released.

The flames rose.
And in their light, he saw something like a smile.
Not on the bark, but in his mind.
A smile of someone who had finally awakened from sleep.

And then, the world began to unravel.

The sky cracked open.
The earth writhed.
Sound vanished.
Light was forgotten.

Only nothingness remained.
A silence where not even thought survived.

…

But in the depths of this absolute void,
in a place beyond comprehension,
a point of light appeared.
Not warm, not cold—simply present.
No beginning, no end.
Only possibility.

Perhaps it was a memory.
Perhaps a chance.

No one will ever know.
And maybe, no one needs to.
