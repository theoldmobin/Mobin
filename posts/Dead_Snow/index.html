        It was night.
Not the night of men—but the night of the earth.
One of those nights when even time seems to have grown cold and stopped.

A nameless man, lonelier than his own shadow, stood at the edge of a silent hill, staring at a city buried far away under a thick layer of snow and forgetfulness.
The city was like a dormant memory—no light, no warmth.
Only silence. Only white.

Beneath his feet, the snow was fresh, soft, untouched.
But not far ahead, a red line cut through the whiteness—a trail of blood leading down into the valley.
He lifted his foot, without knowing why, and stepped onto a memory that didn’t belong to him.

With each step, the crunch of snow beneath his boots sounded like whispered bones.
There was no clear direction, but the blood trail, like an invisible thread, pulled him forward.
He stopped several times. Coughed.
He heard his heartbeat—not in his chest, but in his ears.
A strange weight began to grow inside him—not fatigue, but as if he was carrying himself.

Soon, he saw a man.
Collapsed on the snow, eyes closed, but seemingly waiting.
Wounds marked his body, hidden beneath worn, soaked fabrics.
The nameless man knelt beside him. Took his hand.
But the man, without opening his eyes, murmured:
“They don’t matter… just keep going.”

The wounds were visible now—as if the snow itself had decided to expose them.
Yet the nameless man ignored them.
And the more he ignored them, the more vivid they became.
Not just on that man—but within himself.

Something began to burn in his chest.
Not pain. Not blood.
But a sense that something was wrong… and that it was far too late to turn back.

Along the path, they reached a crumbling wall—
etched with tangled circles, erased names, and the trace of a finger dragged from top to bottom.
The wounded man stood, placing his hand on the wall.
He said:
“They all passed through here. One by one, along this same path.”

The nameless man asked:
“Where are we going?”
But the only answer was his own voice echoing in the snow:
“Where are we going?”

Further ahead, in the midst of a frozen forest, they found a shattered mirror.
The nameless man looked into it—and saw not himself, but a weary man, wounded, wearing a senseless smile.
The same man who had followed him.

He panicked.
Turned away.
Ran.
But the path would not end.
The blood trail continued—as if he had now become part of it.

Eventually, he could go no further.
His knees gave out.
The snow grew warm.
Blood dripped from his side.
He sat there.
Leaning against an ancient, dead tree.

Behind the tree, a narrow stream was flowing,
but from where the man sat, only its sound could be heard.
The tree now resembled that earlier wall.
The sky watched him—detached, indifferent.

And then, a shadow appeared.
Another man.
With the same familiar face, the same wounds, the same wandering gaze.
He knelt down.
Extended a hand.

And before the nameless man closed his eyes—
he smiled.
